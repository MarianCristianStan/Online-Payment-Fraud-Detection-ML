# Online Payment Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

## Project Description
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions on an online payment platform using machine learning algorithms. Using a historical dataset, which includes transactions, the model will learn to classify transactions into two categories: fraudulent and non-fraudulent.

## Project Task
The goal of the project is to train and evaluate a **binary classification** model to detect fraudulent transactions. We will analyze the available data to understand the patterns in fraudulent transactions and build an efficient model to predict fraud based on various transaction features.

## Data

### Dataset Link:
[Online Payment Fraud Detection Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainilcoder/online-payment-fraud-detection/data)

### Dataset Description:
This dataset contains simulated financial transactions from an online payment platform. Each transaction is labeled as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent. The dataset contains **11 features**.

### Dataset Features:

| Column            | Description                                                    |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `step`            | Time unit (1 step = 1 hour).                                   |
| `type`            | Type of transaction (CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT, TRANSFER). |
| `amount`          | The amount involved in the transaction.                        |
| `nameOrig`        | Unique ID of the customer initiating the transaction.          |
| `oldbalanceOrg`   | Initial balance of the sender before the transaction.          |
| `newbalanceOrig`  | Sender’s balance after the transaction.                        |
| `nameDest`        | Unique ID of the recipient of the transaction.                 |
| `oldbalanceDest`  | Initial balance of the recipient before the transaction.       |
| `newbalanceDest`  | Recipient’s balance after the transaction.                     |
| `isFraud`         | Target variable indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1 = fraud, 0 = non-fraud). |
| `isFlaggedFraud`  | The result generated by the applied algorithm (eg: Random Forest)|
